Source code for the new SIM card flaw which lets hijack any phone just by sending SMS - Source Code + Demo Video

### Where's the source code ? 👿

That's what I'm asking you!! Where is it?

### Why did I create this repo ? 💡

Like you, I am very curious about SIM-jacking. I searched for the same things you're searching for.
I didn't find any source code or demo. I became sad :(, so I thought searching with someone else would be more efficient than searching alone. But how can I form a group? So I created this. ;)
